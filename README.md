# House Price Prediction using Machine Learning

## Objective
The goal of this project is to predict house prices using machine learning techniques.

## Dataset
California Housing Dataset.
Target column: MedHouseVal (Median House Value)

## Steps Performed
1. Loaded and explored the dataset
2. Preprocessed the data
3. Split the data into training and testing sets
4. Applied feature scaling
5. Trained Linear Regression model
6. Evaluated model using MAE and RMSE
7. Improved performance using Ridge Regression
8. Visualized actual vs predicted prices

## Models Used
- Linear Regression
- Ridge Regression

## Evaluation Metrics
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

## How to Run
Open the Jupyter Notebook and run all cells sequentially.

## Libraries Used
pandas, numpy, matplotlib, scikit-learn
